FoxMU Web MU Client
-------------------

Version 1.0
(C) 2017 Alynna Trypnotk -- MIT Licence.

Introduction:
 FoxMU is a MU client with very easy setup and low requirements for end users.
 It is based on the hMUD client (0.5) whose development seems to have stopped
 three years ago, I have continued its development for my own projects, however
 I am also releasing it as well.

 I have renamed/forked the software as it seems hMUD is not being developed 
 anymore and I don't want to potentially step on anyone elses trademarks. Also
 I have rewritten parts of the client to make it usable in all MU* 
 architectures, hence the name FoxMU.

Requirements (server side):
- A web server of some kind.   FoxMU should be installed somewhere accessible
  by your web server. (So that you can log in via the web)
- Websockify: https://github.com/novnc/websockify

Requirements (client side):
- A web browser ^o.o^
- Websockets support

!! FoxMU no longer supports Flash, because noone else does. !!
