 Auto-login allows you to store credentials for logging in, in your cookie, so that it will automatically log in when you connect.  To log into another character, you can clear the cookie
 by pressing 'cancel', or store different credentials in there.   If you want to log into another character from the MUCK, try the 'relog' command.
</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:left;">Command Echo</td><td>
 If you want to have your commands echoed to the game, you can turn Command Echo on (or off).
</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:left;">Favorite Font</td><td>
 You can change the font you want to use here.  This setting is saved.  To resize the fonts, you can use your zoom command in your browser (typically, hold shift while using your scroll wheel).
</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:left;">Clear Screen</td><td>
 If what is on your screen offends you, you may use this function to clear the screen.  Or if alot of images are slowing down your experience, you can also partially clear your buffer.
