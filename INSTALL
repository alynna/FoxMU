FoxMU Installation
==================

Requirements (server side):
* A web server of some kind.   FoxMU should be installed somewhere accessible
  by your web server.
* Websockify: git clone https://github.com/novnc/websockify.git
          OR: https://github.com/novnc/websockify/archive/master.zip
  Place it someplace you would want to run it from.  It comes ready to go.

Requirements (client side):
* A web browser ^o.o^
* WebSockets support.  Available wherever HTML 5 web browsers are installed.

!!! FoxMU no longer supports Flash.  Because no browser does anymore. !!!

1 - WebSockify
--------------
After you download Websockify from the above git repository, put it someplace,
then run it with the following command:

 ./run -D <websockport> 127.0.0.1:<muckport>

I recommend making this a startup daemon.

2 - Configuring FoxMU
---------------------

The only file you have to edit to get it going is 'config.js'.  This file
is documented with what the options do.  Here is the list of files with
configurable information:

    * config.js -- Contains the main configuration.  Please note that 
      'host' should be an external address like 'mymuck.com' and 'port'
      should be the websockport used above.  This port can be wherever
      you have a free and open port.
    * header.js -- Configures the area above the output window.  You can
      add or customize all the links that appear there, or redo that area
      entirely.
    * guide.js -- Contains the configuration for the 'command reference'
      on the options menu of FoxMU.  It comes configured for MUCK commands
      but you will probably want to edit it for your game.
    * messages.js -- Configures most system messages and the text on the
      menus.  If you feel the need to customize these any, this is the 
      file you want to touch.

3 - Run the client
------------------

Using the HTML5-compatible browser of your choice, navigate to where you
installed the web client.  For example, if you installed it under foxmu in
your web server's root directory:

    http://mymuck.com/foxmu/index.html

If your webserver is configured properly, you probably don't even need the
'index.html' part.
